description: Review round N on a phase branch (tooling/fix/docs branches get one line — run the agents directly). Step 1 derives the range (round 1 main...HEAD; round N the review-round-(N−1) tag, verified by scripts/round_tag.py read: anchored `round=N−1`, an ancestor of HEAD) and refuses an existing review-round-N tag; step 2 runs make review-gate + make mutate (red → no agents); step 3 prints the spec's Invariants; step 4 spawns code-reviewer + functionality-tester (+ security-reviewer in round 1 when the surface is touched) scoped to the range with "missed in round N−1" labelling; step 5 prints the consolidated table, tags HEAD with `round_tag.py write N` (local, never pushed), and prints "Cap is the architect's call: compare this table to round N−1's". Read-only, report-only, then STOP.

Run review round **$ARGUMENTS** (an integer N ≥ 1) on the current phase branch.
Read-only and report-only, like every agent this command invokes: no edits, no
fixes, no commits, no push. Findings are relayed verbatim and the session STOPS
(CLAUDE.md Git workflow, "STOP-on-findings"). The working tree is never written;
the repo's only writes are a LOCAL annotated tag per round (`round=N`, nothing
else) and the throwaway worktrees `make mutate` and the functionality-tester
register and remove under `.git/worktrees/`.

## 1. Locate the spec and derive the range

- Scope: phase branches only. If the branch is not `phase-*` (a `tooling/*`,
  `fix/*`, `docs/*` branch) print ONE line and STOP:
  `no phase spec for <branch> — tooling/fix branches run the agents directly
  (CLAUDE.md Project tooling)`. Never die on a missing `--spec`; never invent a spec
  so the sweep has something to mutate.
- Spec: the one `specs/phase-*.md` whose slug matches the branch name
  (`phase-3-attribution` → `specs/phase-3-attribution.md`). If none
  matches, ask for `SPEC=` and stop. Set `SPEC=<that path>`.
- Tag collision, checked HERE before anything runs: `uv run python
  scripts/round_tag.py read N` must fail with "missing" — if it prints
  `round=N`, this round already ran: STOP (a round is reviewed once; a re-run is
  round N+1). Any other failure (a malformed tag, a tag from another branch)
  also STOPS — print its line; the developer decides what the tag is.
- Range: round 1 → `RANGE=main...HEAD` (three-dot: the branch since its
  merge-base, so a main that advanced under the branch adds nothing). Round
  N > 1 → `read N−1` must print `round=N−1` (the parser checks the message is
  exactly that line and the tag is an ancestor of HEAD); any failure STOPS.
  `RANGE=review-round-(N−1)..HEAD`.

Print first:

```
Review round N — spec: <SPEC> — range: <RANGE>
git log --oneline <RANGE>
git diff --stat <RANGE>
```

## 2. The deterministic gate first — no agents on a state known broken

Run, in this order, and print every line each emits:

```
make review-gate SPEC=<SPEC> [DELETED=<symbols the phase report lists as removed>]
make mutate SPEC=<SPEC>
```

If either exits non-zero: print its lines under **"GATE RED — no agents
spawned"** and STOP. `make mutate`'s refusal on a spec with no ```mutations block
is red too, and the line it prints names the fix: add `## Invariants` with a
```mutations block — the shape is in `specs/TEMPLATE.md`. The spec is incomplete;
RED is the rule, not a suggestion.

## 3. Print the invariant list

Print the spec's **Invariants** section verbatim — the table, the mutations
block, and every fix amendment appended to it (CLAUDE.md Workflow rules, "Fix
amendments"). A spec with no Invariants section is a BLOCKER finding; record it
and continue with the range alone.

## 4. Spawn the agents, scoped

Spawn **code-reviewer** and **functionality-tester** (that order; both
report-only — no Write/Edit, do not grant more). Each prompt contains:

- the range: "review `git diff <RANGE>`; read every changed file in full";
- the invariant list from step 3, verbatim;
- the labelling rule (the ONE form, CLAUDE.md Workflow rules): "a finding on
  code NOT changed inside <RANGE> — code an earlier round already reviewed — is
  still reported, labelled **`missed in round N−1`**; a finding on code changed
  inside the range carries no label" (round 1: nothing is labelled);
- for the functionality-tester: "the Mutation step and the Evidence-row check
  are mandatory for every write path and guard inside the range; `make mutate`
  already ran — its lines are: <paste>; extend, do not repeat";
- for the code-reviewer: "the Invariants check is mandatory; flag every
  mechanism whose value comes from the caller or the clock rather than the data;
  a dbt model is code — read the SQL and its unit tests".

Round 1 only: if `git diff --name-only <RANGE>` touches `.github/`, `infra/`,
`serving/`, `.env*`, `dbt/profiles.yml`, or a Makefile target that deletes,
applies, or takes `CONFIRM`, also spawn **security-reviewer** with the same range.

## 5. Consolidate, tag, STOP

Print one table over every finding from every agent:

| # | Finding (one sentence) | Raised by | file:line | Class | In range / missed in round N−1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Class is exactly one of **correctness** (wrong output, a survivor, an invariant
with no pin, a caller/clock-sourced mechanism), **security**, **record** (a
stale or missing record sentence), **wording** (names, comments, docs prose).

Tag — every completed round is tagged, so the next round has its boundary:
`uv run python scripts/round_tag.py write N` (HEAD, local, annotated, message
exactly `round=N`; refuses an existing tag; reads itself back; never pushed —
`git push` sends no tag unless asked). Nothing from the table goes into the tag.

Then print, verbatim:

```
Cap is the architect's call: compare this table to round N−1's.
```

The two-round rule (CLAUDE.md Workflow rules, "Review cap") is applied by a
human reading two tables, not by this command — rounds 3–5 of the predecessor's
PR #35 were spent hardening a cap parser the design did not need; it was
deleted (DECISIONS "Process").

Close with the one line the developer decides on per finding: **fix
(wording/test-only)**, **fix amendment (design change → spec paragraph first,
stop for approval)**, or **accept (BACKLOG row with a trigger)**. Then STOP.

This is an explicit, on-request review. Do not treat its presence as a cue to
run it automatically — it runs only when invoked.
